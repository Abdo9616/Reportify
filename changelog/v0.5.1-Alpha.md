## [v0.5.1-Alpha]
- Added self-report protection so users cannot report their own messages.
- Updated `/setreportchannel` to show only text/announcement channels in the `channel` option.
- Made `/setreportchannel channel` optional; when omitted, the current command channel is used.
- Fixed intermittent report submission failures by deferring modal responses and clamping embed field lengths to Discord limits.
